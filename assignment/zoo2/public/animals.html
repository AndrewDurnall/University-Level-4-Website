                        The Chameleon is a truly amazing type of lizard.
                        It is obviously cute but also beautiful,
                        coming in a vast range of color, from red to pink,
                        to blue, turquoise, orange, green and even yellow.
                        There exist roughly 160 species of chameleon mostly
                        found in warm habitats including the rain forest,
                        Madagascar and the desert, but they are also kept as exotic pets by many.
                        Chameleons are distinguished by their funny, swaying gait and strange feet; they
                        have two toes pointing forward and two toes pointing backwards. They also have separately
                        mobile eyes with stereoscopic vision (3 dimensional vision). To feed they use their very
                        long and rapidly extrudable tongues to catch their prey. Certain species of chameleon are
                        able to change
                        their skin coloration and pattern through combinations of blue, pink, red, orange, black,
                        green, brown,
                        light blue, Turquoise, yellow, and purple; making the chameleon one of the coolest animal on
                        earth!

                        Peafowl roam the grounds here at the zoo, Peacocks (male) have
                        impressive bright distinctive coloured feathers and if your lucky might even show you their
                        impressive displays, the peahens (female) have more natural colours to be able to hide
                        when nesting but are just as lovely.

                        Sea lions can be distinguished from true seals because they have external
                        ears and walk on their long mobile flippers. Males are much larger than females with a
                        thick, maned
                        neck and large head, giving them a lion-like appearance. Both sexes have upturned snouts and

                        Unlike most cats tigers like water and are good swimmers and often lie in water to cool
                        down.
                        Tigers can see six times better than people at night.
                        No two tigers have the same pattern of stripes.
                        White flashes at the backs of ears serve as communication. They help cubs follow their
                        mother and also display aggression, threatened tigers twist their ears so the white patches
                        face forward.
                        With just 300-400 Sumatran tigers left in the wild this magnificent sub-species cannot
                        survive without captive breeding programmes.

                        oddly-shaped bills. Their colour is due to diet; small organisms they eat contain a red
                        plant pigment carotene –
                        which is absorbed into the body and deposited in their feathers.

                        Lemurs are unique to Madagascar and are primates but evolved quite differently from monkeys
                        and apes when
                        Madagascar split from the African continent millions of years ago.
                        You are likely to see ring-tailed lemurs sitting on the ground,
                        facing the sun with their arms outspread sun worshipping!

                        Anteaters are found in Central and South America, where they prefer tropical forests and
                        grasslands.
                        There are four different species which vary greatly in size. The silky anteater is the size
                        of a squirrel,
                        while the giant anteater can reach 7 feet (2.1 meters) long from the tip of its snout to the
                        end of its tail.

                        Wilson Zoo holds a large group of Humboldt, or Peruvian, penguins which is one of 17
                        species. They are found along the South American coastline
                        in areas reached by the Humboldt current, and named after German scientist, Alexander Von
                        Humboldt, who explored the region in the late 1700s.
                        ed to their aquatic life. The body is streamlined, feet are webbed and reduced wings,
                        unsuitable for flying, have become flippers.

                        At Wilson Zoo we hold Rothschild’s giraffes which are the world’s rarest subspecies of
                        giraffe.
                        Named after naturalist, Lord Walter Rothschild, they are
                        also known as Baringo giraffes after the Lake Baringo area of Kenya.
                        They are easily identified by the colouring of their coat, which is made up of ragged brown
                        patches separated by lighter creamier-coloured hair, with no markings to the lower leg.
                        Each giraffe has a unique coat pattern, like a fingerprint.
