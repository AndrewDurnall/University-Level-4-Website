              The Event of the week is all about these feathered friends!
              The Rainbow lorikeet is a medium sized Australasian member of the parrot family which is found in the
              rainforest,
              woodland and bush of Australia and eastern Indonesia.
              The lorikeet’s tongue is adapted to its nectar and pollen eating habits by having a hairy brush-like
              structure
              at its tip.
              This is used to pick up pollen and nectar from the flowers on which it feeds.
              At Wilson zoo we house hundreds of lorikeet’s housed in an indoor sanctuary where you can purchase little
              cups
              of syrup to
              lure them down from the air to your hand where they will
              drink out of the cup and give you a very up close look at their cheeky personalities!
